# Random Quote Bot for Discord

This Discord bot retrieves random quotes along with their cover images from a predefined list and sends them to the channel upon command.

## Features

- **!quote**: Sends a random quote along with its cover image.
- **!ping**: Checks if the bot is responsive.

## Installation

1. Install Dependencies: First things first, you'll need to install the necessary Python packages. Open up your terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py

This will install the Discord.py library.

2. Install Additional Dependencies: Since we want to handle voice as well, let's make sure we have all the voice-related dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -U discord.py[voice]

This ensures you have all the required components to handle voice functionalities.

And that's it for installation! Now you're ready to start setting up the bot and making your Discord server a bit more lively. If you run into any issues along the way, feel free to reach out for assistance. Happy coding!

## Usage

1. Invite the bot to your Discord server.
2. Use the '**!quote**' command to get a random quote with its cover image.
3. Use the '**!ping**' command to check if the bot is responsive.
